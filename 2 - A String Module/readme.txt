A simple string module containing the most commonly used functions in "string.h", exactly as described on their manual pages (yes,
their vulnerabilities included). Also patched a function signature in order to avoid compilation warnings, while frequently using
assertions within the functions. Note that we were assigned to create 2 different implementations, one with arrays and one with pointer
arithmetics. main.c contains leftover code from testing.
