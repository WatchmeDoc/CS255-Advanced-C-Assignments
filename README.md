# CS-255 Advanced C assignments

All 6 assigments from the course CS-255 (https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy255) as implemented by me.
I think the most interesting one is assignment 6 as it focuses on program's memory and how to alter 
the program's behavior by exploiting the code and using its own memory. The rest of the assignments
are much simpler. Unfortunately the descriptions are all in Greek, but hopefully I got them covered
in readme files.

Enjoy :)
